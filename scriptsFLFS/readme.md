Scripts for analyzing the single-photon data as in Perego, E., Zappone, S., et al. Content-enriched fluorescence lifetime fluctuation spectroscopy to study bio-molecular condensate formation (2023) bioRxiv 2023.06.09.544221; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.09.544221

Part of the **BrightEyes-TTM, an open-source project**. 
Intensity based data can be analyzed with the script "svFCS_IntesityBased", while time-tagged data with the Jupyter notebook "svFCS_TimeTaggingBased". 
With this scripts, it is possible to analyze single-photon data acquired with a SPAD array detector and perform spot-variation-FCS, FLCS and dual-color lifetime FCCS.
